Note: The train line we want to track is - 
BEZIERS -> MONTPELLIER -> NIMES -> Arles -> MARSEILLE

TOULOUSE<->Montpellier must have a maximum of 831222 connections per year (since that's the smallest number of people on that stretch)
That's a total of 2277.32054795 per day

--Passengers by train through MONTPELLIER in 2017--
Montpellier Saint-Roch;8125316
Montpellier Sud de France;0 #Wow, really? Zero?

We assume that a total of 8125316-1406529 = 6718787 travel through to Nimes

--Passengers by train through NIMES in 2017--
Nimes = 3862495
Assume that this stretch is entirely Montpellier<-Nimes->Marseille

Total travelling to and from:
BEZIERS    = 1406529

MONTPELLIER = 8125316

NIMES       = 3862495

MARSEILLE   = 16546458

Let's just find a total approximate ecosystem, divide the commuters, and divide those by the rest

East from Beziers    = 1406529 - 1275313 = 131216
W/E from Montpellier = 8125316 - 1275313 = 6850003
W/E from Nimes       = 3862495 - 458167 - 352811 = 3051517
W from Marseille = 16546458 - 2619162 - 5012280 - 4096693 - 129047  = 4689276

We assume that the size of commuting traffic is the sum of the two largest cities, and allocate totals based on population size:
4689276+6850003 = 11539279

31600 people commute per day in this system
PopCity/(861635+277639+75999+150672) =>
0.63   population from Marseille
0.20   pop from Montpellier
0.056  pop from Beziers
0.114  pop from Nimes
