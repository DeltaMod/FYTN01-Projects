The main file that I (Vidar) have been working on is: "V.F and S.P - P1b-SIS_SIR.py"
It should be heavily commented so that it should (mostly) make sense!

Summary: Euler ODE solver for disease propagation
Features: 
+ SIS and SIR models
+ Vaccination
+ Waning Immunity
+ Daily commuter weighting
+ Single, Predefined, and N number of random cities that can be run with these conditions
