The main file is  "Main - P1b-SIS_SIR Model.py"
It should be heavily commented so that it should (mostly) make sense!

Features: 
+ SIS and SIR models
+ Vaccination
+ Waning Immunity
+ Daily commuter weighting
+ Single, Predefined, and N number of random cities that can be run with these conditions

 Located in FYTN03-Projects/Project 2 - Image Restoration
 We have two main files:
+ P2-FirstApproach.py - Which contains a standard the Laplacian implementation of image restoration
+ Main - IMRestore.py - Which contains several different implementations of image convolution filters.
                        Currently, the default 3x3-Gauss followed by 5x5-Gauss patches up the image pretty well
                        (you can run it for longer for better results)
                        The code contains a real space convolution, as well as full image convolution in frequency space,
                        AND a sectioned method that handles only the pixels surrounding the max!

Located in FYTN03-Projects/Project 3 - Stochastic Process
Two main files:
+P3-VoxelTests.py - contains an initial implementation using a vector matrix with walkers indicated by a 1 or a 0. 
                    Features annihilation when walkers coincide with each other.
                    
+P3-Main.py       - Contains two main modes of operation, with WalkerType="Aggro"|"Exploding"
                    Agresive walkers in the "Aggro" mode searches for the nearest passive walker, moves towards them if within a radius
                    Uses a two matrix finding algorithm to determine nearest neighbour, which significantly reduces computation times.
                    Currently loaded parameters should provide a high probability of a stable predator-prey populaton cycle  
                    The script should contain sufficient documentation to figure out the rest
